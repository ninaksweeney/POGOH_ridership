As a soon-to-be Pittsburgher, I was very excited to learn that Pittsburgh's nonprofit bike share organization, POGOH, is an ever-growing presence in the city. Offering a simple membership program with access to traditional bikes and e-bikes, it provides a year-round, flexible public transit solution. Below I've used POGOH's open source ridership data, as well as hourly weather data from Open-Meteo API, to understand the POGOH's rider behavior and the factors that affect it.

Using this data, I hope to answer some of the following questions:

- Has the city population adopted the bikeshare program, and is adoption growing or shrinking?
- When and where are people riding the most?
- Do different neighborhoods exhibit different usage behavior?
- How do factors like hourly weather and day of the week affect ridership?
  
And most importantly,

- What actions can POGOH take using our insights to better serve its riders and increase bikeshare adoption?
  
**Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis** - understand the overall shape of the ride data and what anomalies exist. Ask and answer questions about ride counts in relation to other variables and start to understand potential correlations.

**Part 2: (to be completed) Predictive Analysis** - perform a predictive analysis in Scikit-Learn to predict POGOH ridership, and complete some tuning to increase the model's effectiveness
